/*An online CD shop awards points to its customers based on the total
number of audio CDs purchased each month. The points are awarded as
follows:
If the customer purchases 1 CD, he or she is awarded 3 points.
If the customer purchases 2 CDs, he or she is awarded 10 points.
If the customer purchases 3 CDs, he or she is awarded 20 points.
If the customer purchases 4 CDs or more, he or she is awarded 45
points.
Write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter the total number of
CDs that he or she has purchased in a month, and then displays the
number of points awarded. Assume that the user enters a valid value.*/
